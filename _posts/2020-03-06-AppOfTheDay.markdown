## English version

> Card Diary is recommended by App Store: [APP OF THE DAY](https://apps.apple.com/story/id1433996215)

**Do you remember** what you did on this day a year ago? Perhaps you were lounging by the pool on holiday; or enjoying the company of your family; maybe it was just another steady day at the office. Every day, whether it’s an extra special one or of the average kind, is worth recording. And the minimalist journaling app Card Diary is the perfect storage space for your days.

With one picture a day, the app helps you to create a truly personalised diary. Your picture doesn’t have to be anything fancy (especially on those days where nothing astounding happens): maybe it’s a cute picture of your moody cat or a street in your neighbourhood looking particularly glorious with a dusting of pink sky overhead.

> Your diary is organised according to months of the year. Set the month’s best photo as its cover image.

To add your photo for the day, tap the pencil icon on the app’s home screen, then compose a title, choose what the weather was doing using the sun icon and finally (the best bit), write. Whatever you feel like goes: maybe it’s just one word, or a short story about something incredible that happened, or even a little rant about a frustrating part of your day!

Whatever you record, Card Diary will save it and neatly arrange each entry under its designated month. If you miss a day (or a few) you can tap the diary icon in any month, select the missed date and then log a picture and any thoughts for that day.

> Diary entries for each day can be saved as cards. You can make an entry with just text, but a photo will make it truly memorable.

Not every day will be particularly eventful of course and when that happens, take a quick photo and add a few words – it could well be the ideal opportunity to pause, reflect on things and have a moment of appreciation for a wonderfully average day. Set yourself a challenge to record for 365 days of the year and you’ll soon find journaling becomes a habit. You might just catch yourself on the lookout for interesting things in your day, however small, something you might not do otherwise.

*Card Diary makes journaling a simple, mindful and highly rewarding activity. So, what did you do today?*
